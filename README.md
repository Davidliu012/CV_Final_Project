# CV_Final_Project

## Operations

Using New Environment
```
conda create -n myproject python=3.10.6
```

```
conda activate myproject
```

In the correct path: B11901174/Source Code
```
cd Source Code
```

Install Environment Variables
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running Test Videos:
```
python algorithm_template.py --test
```

Running Sample Videos:

```
python algorithm_template.py --sample
```

The output would be in the path:
```
output/Test Videos/algorithm_output.json
```
### Note: We have done some minor modifications to more fit all the cases, so there may be some minor difference compared to our submissions

## Sample Files for Door State Monitoring Algorithm Development

### Sample Video Files

- `01.mp4`
- `02.mp4`
- `03.mp4`

### Test Video Files

- `01.mp4`
- `03.mp4`
- `05.mp4`
- `07.mp4`
- `09.mp4`

These video files are provided for use in developing and testing your door state monitoring algorithm.

### Python Scripts

- `total_frames.py`: Retrieves the total number of frames in a video file.
- `algorithm_template.py`: Provides a template for creating a JSON file that can be used for evaluation.
- `evaluate.py`: Implements the scoring method to assess the accuracy of the door state monitoring algorithm. Run this script to evaluate your algorithm based on the sample video files.

### JSON Files

- `ground_truth_annotations.json`: Contains the ground truth data for the sample video files. Essential for algorithm evaluation.
- `algorithm_output.json`: An example of a JSON file generated by `algorithm_template.py`, used for evaluation purposes.
